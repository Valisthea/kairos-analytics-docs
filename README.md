# Kairos Analytics

**On-chain behavioral analytics for Web3 applications.**

Kairos Analytics lets you track user behavior, measure conversions, and verify data integrity — without relying on Google, Mixpanel, or any centralized third party. Events are signed and stored on Base mainnet, making your analytics tamper-proof and permanently auditable.

## Why Kairos Analytics?

Traditional analytics tools store your data on their servers. They can be blocked by ad blockers, disabled by privacy regulations, or simply taken down. Kairos Analytics routes events through a lightweight relayer that batches and commits them to the blockchain — your data belongs to you, forever.
