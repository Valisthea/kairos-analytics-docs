# Kairos Analytics

**Real-time behavioral analytics for Web3 applications — with on-chain proof of integrity.**

Kairos Analytics tracks what happens on your frontend before the transaction: where users hesitate, which flows convert, where they drop off. Every event batch is cryptographically anchored on-chain — making your analytics tamper-proof and permanently verifiable.

## Why Kairos Analytics?

Most analytics tools show you what happened on-chain. Kairos shows you what happened **before** the transaction — the clicks, the navigation, the friction. Combined with on-chain proof, it's the only platform where your data is both behavioral and verifiable.

| | Google Analytics | Mixpanel | Dune Analytics | **Kairos Analytics** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Behavioral tracking | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Web3 / wallet events | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| On-chain data proof | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Data you own | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Works without cookies | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Integration time | 5 min | 30 min | N/A | **3 min** |

> ⚠️ **Note on "data integrity":** On-chain proof in Kairos verifies that **your analytics data was not modified after collection**. It does not require users to connect a wallet — proof is handled server-side by the relayer. Wallet connection is optional and only relevant if you track wallet events in your dApp.
