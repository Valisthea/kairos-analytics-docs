## Event Limits

Each plan includes a monthly event allowance. Events are counted on a rolling 30-day basis. When you approach your limit (80%), a warning appears in the Volume widget. If you exceed your limit, events continue to be tracked but new events are not included in Merkle proof batches until the next billing cycle.

You won't lose data — events that arrive over the limit are stored but not cryptographically proven until the cycle resets.

## Billing

Paid plans are billed monthly via Stripe. Your card is charged on the same date each month (the date you first subscribed).

**Upgrading**: Takes effect immediately. You're charged the prorated amount for the remainder of the current billing cycle, then the full amount on your next billing date.

**Downgrading**: Takes effect at the end of the current billing cycle. You keep access to your current plan's features until then.

**Canceling**: Same as downgrading to Free. Your data is retained according to the Free plan's 30-day retention policy.

## Payment Methods

Stripe supports all major credit and debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover) as well as region-specific payment methods. 3D Secure is supported for cards that require it.

## Invoices

Invoices are available in your dashboard under Settings → Billing. Stripe sends email receipts automatically after each successful payment.

## Future: Aster Native Plan

A fourth plan — **Aster Native** ($49/month) — will be available when Asterchain launches. It includes proof anchoring on Asterchain with a permanent rate lock for early adopters. No fixed launch date.

## FAQ

**What happens if I exceed my event limit?**
Events continue to be tracked and stored, but they're not included in K-PPE proof batches until your next billing cycle.

**Can I change plans at any time?**
Yes. Upgrades take effect immediately. Downgrades take effect at the end of the current cycle.

**Is there a free trial for paid plans?**
The Free plan itself is the trial — you get the full pipeline (tracking, hashing, dashboard) with 5M events/month and 7 widgets. Upgrade when you need more.

**Do you offer annual billing?**
Not yet. Monthly billing only for now.
